Danielle has asked you to install R and R Studio on your machine, then to work through a tutorial to learn the basics of analytics and visualization using R. Within your tutorial, you’ll be working through a regression analysis using a linear regression model. In this simple analysis, you’ll be predicting distances through the speed of certain cars. The dataset that you’ll be using through this analysis is the cars.csv file, which is located within Danielle’s email.

Blackwell believes that the best way to learn is through trial and error, so after your tutorial, you’ll be asked to test your knowledge through running a script of code. The dataset that you’ll be using through this analysis is the iris.csv file, which is also in the zip file attached to Danielle’s email. Don’t be too surprised if you encounter errors or warning messages. Take a few deep breaths and embrace the errors!

Once you’ve completed both tasks, you'll submit an informal report to Danielle about your experience switching to R, the errors that you encountered in the task, the reasons behind them, and how you overcame them. You should also include discussion of the outcomes your model predicted.
